"Based on the academic paper, here's the strategy extraction:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy_name\": \"Hybrid S&P 500 Volatility Forecasting Strategy\",\n  \"core_mechanism\": \"Multi-model volatility prediction using ensemble machine learning and statistical techniques to forecast S&P 500 index volatility\",\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"VIX Index\",\n      \"definition\": \"CBOE Volatility Index representing market sentiment and expected market volatility\",\n      \"parameters\": [\"Real-time market sentiment indicator\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"GARCH Volatility\",\n      \"definition\": \"Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model capturing historical volatility patterns\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        \"Historical price return variance\",\n        \"Conditional variance estimation\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"LSTM Volatility\",\n      \"definition\": \"Long Short-Term Memory neural network processing time series volatility data\",\n      \"parameters\": [\n        \"Past volatility\",\n        \"Log returns\",\n        \"Sequential learning parameters\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_formulas\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Hybrid Volatility Forecast\",\n      \"latex\": \"\\\\sigma_{t+1} = f(GARCH, LSTM, VIX)\",\n      \"python_equivalent\": \"volatility_forecast = ensemble_model(garch_model, lstm_model, vix_data)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"asset_classes\": [\"S&P 500 Index\", \"Equity Market Indices\"],\n  \"market_conditions\": [\n    \"High market uncertainty\",\n    \"Volatile market environments\",\n    \"Periods of significant market sentiment shifts\"\n  ],\n  \"time_frames\": [\n    \"Daily\",\n    \"Short to medium-term investment horizons\"\n  ],\n  \"risk_management\": {\n    \"position_sizing\": \"Dynamic allocation based on predicted volatility\",\n    \"stop_loss\": \"Implemented through volatility forecast confidence intervals\",\n    \"risk_limits\": \"Adjust portfolio exposure based on predicted volatility magnitude\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKey observations:\n1. The strategy is a novel approach combining multiple predictive models\n2. Focuses on volatility forecasting rather than direct price prediction\n3. Uses an ensemble approach integrating statistical (GARCH) and machine learning (LSTM) techniques\n4. Incorporates market sentiment via VIX index\n5. Primarily designed for S&P 500 index risk management\n6. Applicable during periods of market uncertainty\n\nThe strategy's primary innovation is its multi-model approach to volatility prediction, offering more robust and adaptive forecasting compared to traditional single-model methods."
