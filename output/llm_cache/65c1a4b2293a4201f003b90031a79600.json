"Based on the paper description, here's the extracted strategy details:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy_name\": \"Spatio-Temporal Momentum Strategy\",\n  \"core_mechanism\": \"A neural network-based approach that simultaneously generates trading signals by incorporating both time-series and cross-sectional momentum features across multiple assets\",\n  \"indicators\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Time-Series Momentum\",\n      \"definition\": \"Capturing past price trends within individual asset time series\",\n      \"parameters\": [\"Lookback period not explicitly specified\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cross-Sectional Momentum\", \n      \"definition\": \"Comparing momentum characteristics across different assets in the portfolio\",\n      \"parameters\": [\"Relative ranking of assets' momentum features\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_formulas\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Neural Network Trading Signal Generation\",\n      \"latex\": \"\\\\text{Trading Signal} = f(\\\\text{Time-Series Momentum}, \\\\text{Cross-Sectional Momentum})\",\n      \"python_equivalent\": \"def generate_trading_signals(time_series_momentum, cross_sectional_momentum):\\n    # Single fully connected layer neural network\\n    return neural_network_layer(time_series_momentum, cross_sectional_momentum)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"asset_classes\": [\n    \"US Equities\",\n    \"Equity Index Futures\"\n  ],\n  \"market_conditions\": [\n    \"Multiple asset portfolios\",\n    \"Liquid markets\",\n    \"Low to moderate transaction costs (5-10 basis points)\"\n  ],\n  \"time_frames\": [\n    \"Not explicitly specified, likely daily or weekly\"\n  ],\n  \"risk_management\": {\n    \"position_sizing\": \"Least absolute shrinkage and turnover regularization\",\n    \"stop_loss\": \"Not explicitly specified\",\n    \"risk_limits\": {\n      \"transaction_costs\": \"Up to 5-10 basis points\",\n      \"portfolio_composition\": \"46 US equities and 12 equity index futures\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKey Observations:\n1. The strategy uses a novel neural network approach to generate trading signals\n2. Combines both time-series and cross-sectional momentum in a unified framework\n3. Focuses on capturing momentum across multiple assets simultaneously\n4. Emphasizes regularization to manage trading costs and portfolio turnover\n5. Demonstrates robustness across different market conditions and asset classes\n\nThe strategy's primary innovation is integrating time-series and cross-sectional momentum through a simple neural network architecture, providing a more holistic approach to momentum investing."
