The key strengths are its neural network-based signal generation and backtesting across multiple asset classes. However, critical implementation details like explicit exit rules, precise position sizing, and specific signal thresholds are not comprehensively defined, preventing direct replication. The strategy score of 0.6 reflects its promising conceptual framework but incomplete practical implementation."
