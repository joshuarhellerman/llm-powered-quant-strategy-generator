    "title": "The Hybrid Forecast of S&P 500 Volatility ensembled from VIX, GARCH and   LSTM models",
    "abstract": "Predicting the S&P 500 index volatility is crucial for investors and financial analysts as it helps assess market risk and make informed investment decisions. Volatility represents the level of uncertainty or risk related to the size of changes in a security's value, making it an essential indicator for financial planning. This study explores four methods to improve the accuracy of volatility forecasts for the S&P 500: the established GARCH model, known for capturing historical volatility patterns; an LSTM network that utilizes past volatility and log returns; a hybrid LSTM-GARCH model that combines the strengths of both approaches; and an advanced version of the hybrid model that also factors in the VIX index to gauge market sentiment. This analysis is based on a daily dataset that includes S&P 500 and VIX index data, covering the period from January 3, 2000, to December 21, 2023. Through rigorous testing and comparison, we found that machine learning approaches, particularly the hybrid LSTM models, significantly outperform the traditional GARCH model. Including the VIX index in the hybrid model further enhances its forecasting ability by incorporating real-time market sentiment. The results of this study offer valuable insights for achieving more accurate volatility predictions, enabling better risk management and strategic investment decisions in the volatile environment of the S&P 500.",

    "title": "Robust Detection of Lead-Lag Relationships in Lagged Multi-Factor Models",
    "abstract": "In multivariate time series systems, key insights can be obtained by discovering lead-lag relationships inherent in the data, which refer to the dependence between two time series shifted in time relative to one another, and which can be leveraged for the purposes of control, forecasting or clustering. We develop a clustering-driven methodology for robust detection of lead-lag relationships in lagged multi-factor models. Within our framework, the envisioned pipeline takes as input a set of time series, and creates an enlarged universe of extracted subsequence time series from each input time series, via a sliding window approach. This is then followed by an application of various clustering techniques, (such as k-means++ and spectral clustering), employing a variety of pairwise similarity measures, including nonlinear ones. Once the clusters have been extracted, lead-lag estimates across clusters are robustly aggregated to enhance the identification of the consistent relationships in the original universe. We establish connections to the multireference alignment problem for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Since multivariate time series are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, we demonstrate that our method is not only able to robustly detect lead-lag relationships in financial markets, but can also yield insightful results when applied to an environmental data set.",

    "title": "Spatio-Temporal Momentum: Jointly Learning Time-Series and   Cross-Sectional Strategies",
    "abstract": "We introduce Spatio-Temporal Momentum strategies, a class of models that unify both time-series and cross-sectional momentum strategies by trading assets based on their cross-sectional momentum features over time. While both time-series and cross-sectional momentum strategies are designed to systematically capture momentum risk premia, these strategies are regarded as distinct implementations and do not consider the concurrent relationship and predictability between temporal and cross-sectional momentum features of different assets. We model spatio-temporal momentum with neural networks of varying complexities and demonstrate that a simple neural network with only a single fully connected layer learns to simultaneously generate trading signals for all assets in a portfolio by incorporating both their time-series and cross-sectional momentum features. Backtesting on portfolios of 46 actively-traded US equities and 12 equity index futures contracts, we demonstrate that the model is able to retain its performance over benchmarks in the presence of high transaction costs of up to 5-10 basis points. In particular, we find that the model when coupled with least absolute shrinkage and turnover regularization results in the best performance over various transaction cost scenarios.",
