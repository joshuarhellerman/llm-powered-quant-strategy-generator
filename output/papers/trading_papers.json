    "title": "The Hybrid Forecast of S&P 500 Volatility ensembled from VIX, GARCH and\n  LSTM models",
    "abstract": "Predicting the S&P 500 index volatility is crucial for investors and\nfinancial analysts as it helps assess market risk and make informed investment\ndecisions. Volatility represents the level of uncertainty or risk related to\nthe size of changes in a security's value, making it an essential indicator for\nfinancial planning. This study explores four methods to improve the accuracy of\nvolatility forecasts for the S&P 500: the established GARCH model, known for\ncapturing historical volatility patterns; an LSTM network that utilizes past\nvolatility and log returns; a hybrid LSTM-GARCH model that combines the\nstrengths of both approaches; and an advanced version of the hybrid model that\nalso factors in the VIX index to gauge market sentiment. This analysis is based\non a daily dataset that includes S&P 500 and VIX index data, covering the\nperiod from January 3, 2000, to December 21, 2023. Through rigorous testing and\ncomparison, we found that machine learning approaches, particularly the hybrid\nLSTM models, significantly outperform the traditional GARCH model. Including\nthe VIX index in the hybrid model further enhances its forecasting ability by\nincorporating real-time market sentiment. The results of this study offer\nvaluable insights for achieving more accurate volatility predictions, enabling\nbetter risk management and strategic investment decisions in the volatile\nenvironment of the S&P 500.",
